## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m a passionate fourth-year Computer Engineering student with a strong interest in programming and web development. Through hands-on experience in multiple web projects, Iâ€™ve developed various technical skills as a frontend developer, working with modern tools and frameworks to build a  user-friendly interfaces.

As part of a 6-month cooperative education program, I worked as a Software Engineer Intern, where I not only enhanced my technical abilities but also improved my communication and collaboration skillsâ€”key qualities that enable me to work effectively in team-based and real-world development environments.
